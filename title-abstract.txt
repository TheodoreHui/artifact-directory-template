Title:
EDH-LLM: Using NLP techniques to build card game decks

Abstract:
In this project, we propose a novel system for generating playable decks for the card game, "Magic: The Gathering," in the commander format (also known as EDH; Elder Dragon Highlander). This task combines hard and soft restrictions, maximizing the validity, playability, and power of a deck, in addition to an issue of scale, as there are thousands of possible cards, leading to over $10^{285}$ total possible decks. To address the holistic demands of this deck-building task in this large search space, our system features Natural Language Processing techniques, like Word2Vec, alongside a Large Language Model (LLM) in the loop. In this way, we extract the maximum utility from the semi-structured text data provided with each card and create valid decks with almost no supervised data. Alongside an existing heuristic for evaluating the power level of EDH decks, we also propose a new, count-based metric for predicting card synergy based on unlabeled historical play data.
